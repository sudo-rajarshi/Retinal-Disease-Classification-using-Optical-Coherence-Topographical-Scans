# Retinal-Disease-Classification-using-Optical-Coherence-Topographical-Scans
This is a multiclass classification of different retinal disease like-
1. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
2. Diabetic macular edema (DME)
3. Drusen
4. Normal Condition.

Using advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms the results of the classification are-
1. Training Accuracy = 99.91 %
2. Validation Accuracy = 95.92 %
3. Test Accuracy = 96.52 %

4. Sensitivity = 99.13 %
5. Specificity = 97.95 %
