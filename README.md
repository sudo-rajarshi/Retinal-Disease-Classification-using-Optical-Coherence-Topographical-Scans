# Retinal-Disease-Classification-using-Optical-Coherence-Topographical-Scans
This is a multiclass classification of different retinal disease like-
1. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
2. Diabetic macular edema (DME)
3. Drusen
4. Normal Condition.

Using advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms the results of the classification are-
1. Training Accuracy = 99.92 %
2. Validation Accuracy = 94.11 %
3. Test Accuracy = 93.54 %

4. Sensitivity = 98.89 %
5. Specificity = 95.63 %
